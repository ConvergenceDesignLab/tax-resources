    <h2>Filling out Your W-4 Tax Form</h2>

    <p>
      After completing your I-9, you will be asked to complete a W-4. A W-4 is a
      document that tells your employer how much tax to withhold from your
      paycheck.
    </p>

    <p>
      To complete the W-4, fill out the “Personal Allowances Worksheet.” If you
      are
      <strong>independent</strong>, put a 1 on line A. If you are
      <strong>dependent</strong>, put 0. Read the rest of B - G and fill them in
      accurately. Calculate a total for line H.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now fill in the section under “Employee’s Withholding Allowance
      Certificate.” Be sure to copy that total from line H to line 5. Complete
      the rest of the form and sign it. The lines below your signature - lines
      8, 9 and 10 - will be completed by your employer.
    </p>
