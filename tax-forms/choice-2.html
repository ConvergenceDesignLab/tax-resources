    <h2>Independent Contractors vs Employment</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When working, some positions such as Uber, Lyft or some summer youth
        employment jobs are considered independent contractors, while similar
        positions such as city bus drivers are considered employees.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are many rules that help decide whether someone is a contractor or
        employee, but you can recognize how you are being classified by the
        <strong>forms you are asked to fill out</strong> on or before your first
        day.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are an employee, an employer will ask you to fill out a form W-4,
        which contains questions that determine your withholding. Withholding is
        the money that is withheld from your paycheck each pay period.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are being classified as an independent contractor, you
        <strong>may</strong> be asked to complete form W-9 when you start
        working, and taxes will generally NOT be withheld from your paycheck. It
        is important to set aside money each month as you may have to pay taxes
        on the money that you have earned later.
