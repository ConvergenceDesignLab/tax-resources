    <h2>Your taxes</h2>

    <p>At the end of the year, your employer will send you a W-2 form with information about how much money you made. You may
        need to file a tax return. To get free help with your taxes during tax season, look up
        <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank">Vita Sites</a> in your area. This service is only available during tax season (January - April).</p>

    <p>Please be sure to keep a copy of your W-2 to complete your taxes and be sure to keep a record of your employer's contact
        information in case you have any questions.</p>
