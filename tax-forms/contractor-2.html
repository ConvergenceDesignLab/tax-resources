    <h2>Pay Stub</h2>

    <p>
      When your employer pays you your stipend or contractual payment, you may
      receive a pay stub. You will note that taxes are not withheld from your
      payment at this time, but you may owe taxes later.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some independent contractors end up owing when they file their taxes at
      the end of the year, but this may not be the case if you have only earned
      a small amount of money. Do NOT spend everything that you make.
