    <h3>What you need to know for your tax forms:</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>You need to know your dependency status to complete your tax forms.</strong> Does someone else (such as a parent
        or guardian) claim you as a
        <em>dependent?</em> A dependent is someone who is still living with and financially supported by a parent or guardian.
        Try to find out your dependency status before you start work.</p>
