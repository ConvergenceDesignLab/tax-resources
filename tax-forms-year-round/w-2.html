      Long after your summer job is done, around late January, you will receive
      a W-2 from your old employer. This form is used to file your taxes.

      If you wrote ‘exempt’ on your w4 you probably do not need to file a tax
      return. However, if you are getting some money withheld on your paycheck,
      you might want to consider filing a tax return to get that money back in a
      refund. Go to
      <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank"

      >
      Be sure to keep all your tax paperwork in a safe place.

      If you want help with your taxes but cannot make it to a tax preparation
      service, think about filing your taxes online with

      Remember, when filing your taxes, you are able to deduct some expenses
      from your taxable income, which reduces your tax bill &#45; usually
      through a <strong>standard deduction.</strong> Don’t forget about this
      when filing your taxes.
