        <p>Long after your summer job is done, around late January, you will receive a W-2 from your old employer. This form is used to file your taxes.</p>

        <p>If you wrote ‘exempt’ on your w4 you probably do not need to file a tax return. However, if you are getting some money withheld on your paycheck, you might want to consider filing a tax return to get that money back in a refund. Go to <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank">https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep</a> Be sure to keep all your tax paperwork in a safe place.</p>

        <p>If you want help with your taxes but cannot make it to a tax preparation service, think about filing your taxes online with <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-free-file-the-fast-safe-and-free-way-to-do-your-taxes" target="_blank">IRS Free File.</a> Remember, when filing your taxes, you are able to deduct some expenses from your taxable income, which reduces your tax bill &#45; usually through a <strong>standard deduction.</strong> Don’t forget about this when filing your taxes.</p>
