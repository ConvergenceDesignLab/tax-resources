    <h2>I-9 Forms: The First Step to Starting Work</h2>

    <p>
      The I-9 Form is a form required by the government to verify employment
      eligibility. You will need one or two documents to prove your eligibility,
      and then you will need to sign a page stating you are eligible for
      employment in the United States.

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        A complete list of acceptable documents can be found in the I-9 form’s
        instructions, and by law, you are allowed to use any of the documents
        listed, but almost everyone uses:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Just their US passport or foreign passport containing their visa or
          permanent resident card.

      You should bring these documents on your first day of work or to your
      orientation as instructed, BUT you must bring the ORIGINAL documents as
      copies are not acceptable. Be sure to keep your documents SAFE and to only
      show them to someone you trust like your employer or your banker/financial
      institution representative/college, etc.
