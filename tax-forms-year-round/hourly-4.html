    <h2>Your Pay Stub</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>
        When you receive your pay, your employer will send you a pay stub. This
        will show you how much pay you will take home & how much was withheld.
      </strong>
      Scroll over the stars on this sample pay stub to understand how much pay
      you will take home, and why some money is automatically withheld from your
      paycheck.
    </p>
