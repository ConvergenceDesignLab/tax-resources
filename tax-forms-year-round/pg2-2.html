    <h3>Filling out Your W-4 Tax Form</h3>

    <p>
        Fill out the “Personal Allowances Worksheet.” If you are
        <strong>independent</strong>, put a 1 on line A. If you are
        <strong>dependent</strong>, put 0. Read the rest of B - G and fill them in accurately. Calculate a total for line H.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now fill in the section under “Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate.” Be sure to copy that total from line H to line
        5. Complete the rest of the form and sign it. The lines below your signature - lines 8, 9 and 10 - will be completed
        by your employer.
