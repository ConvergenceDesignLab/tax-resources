    <h2>Tax information for Independent Contractors</h2>

    <p>
      A W-9 is a form that is used to collect basic information from independent
      contractors like their name and social security number. The W-9 will be
      used by the organization that you are working with as an independent
      contractor to generate a 1099 form at the end of the year, if you received
      more than $600. Click
      <a target="_blank" href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf">here</a>
      to view a W-9 form.
    </p>

    <p>
      To complete your W-9, read all of the information carefully and complete
      the form to reflect your specific situation, but for MOST youth:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Write your full legal name on line 1.</li>
      <li>Skip the business name on line 2 (unless this pertains to you).</li>
      <li>
        Select that you are an individual for line 3 (unless another selection
        applies).
      </li>
      <li>Skip line item 4 (unless this applies).</li>
      <li>Complete your correct address for lines 5 & 6.</li>
      <li>Skip line 7 (unless this applies).</li>
      <li>
        Carefully and legibly enter your social security number for Part I.
        (Almost all youth will enter a social security number and NOT an
        employer identification number. Skip the employer identification number
        unless it applies.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Review all certifications, and if they are all correct, sign and date
        the form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your W-9 includes identifying information such as your social security
        number, so keep this form safe and promptly turn it in to your job site
        organization.
      </li>
    </ol>
