    <h3>Filling out Your W-4 Tax Form</h3>

    <p>
      Fill out the “Personal Allowances Worksheet.” If you are
      <strong>independent</strong>, put a 1 on line A. If you are
      <strong>dependent</strong>, put 0. Read the rest of B - G and fill them in
      accurately. Calculate a total for line H.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now fill in the section under “Employee’s Withholding Allowance
      Certificate.” Be sure to copy that total from line H to line 5. Complete
      the rest of the form and sign it. The lines below your signature - lines
      8, 9 and 10 - will be completed by your employer.
