    <h2>Your taxes: W-2 Forms</h2>

    <p>
      At the end of the year, your employer will send you a W-2 form with
      information about how much money you made. You will generally be required
      to file a tax return if you earn $10,000 or more. However, even if you do
      not have to file taxes, you may want to do so to get back any extra money
      that was withheld and might be returned to you, even if you are a
      dependent. If the government withheld too much money and you get some
      back, that money is called your refund. To get free help with your taxes
      during tax season, look up
      <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank"

      in your area. This service is generally only available during tax season
      (January - April) but is FREE for people who earned less than $54,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be sure to keep a copy of your W-2 to complete your taxes and be
      sure to keep a record of your employer's contact information in case you
      have any questions. Taxes must be filed by April 15th for most people.
