    <h2>1099 Form</h2>

    <p>
      At the end of the year, all independent contractors that complete a W-9
      should receive a 1099 form with information about how much money you made
      from the organization, if you received more than $600. Depending upon how
      much you earned, you may need to file a tax return. You are required to
      file a tax return if you earn $400 or more as an independent contractor
      even if you do not receive a 1099. To get free help with your taxes during
      tax season, look up
      <a href="https://irs.treasury.gov/freetaxprep/" target="_blank"

      in your area. This service is only available during tax season (January -
      April).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please be sure to keep a copy of your 1099 safe and accessible to complete
      your taxes and be sure to keep a record of your employer's contact
      information in case you have any questions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Taxes must be filed by April 15th for most people.</strong></p>
