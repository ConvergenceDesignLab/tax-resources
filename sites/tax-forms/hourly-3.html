    <h2>Filling out Your W-4 Tax Form</h2>

    <p>
      After completing your I-9, you will be asked to complete a W-4. A W-4 is a
      document that tells your employer how much tax to withhold from your
      paycheck.
    </p>

    <p>
      To complete the W-4, fill out the “Employee’s Withholding Certificate.”
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Enter your personal information and select your filing status. Most
        youth will select the Single or Married Filing Separately box. (You may
        check ‘head of household’ if you are living with your own child, but you
        must be living independently and supporting yourself.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Most youth will skip steps 2, 3 and 4. (You may want to use the
        estimator at <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator" target="_blank">https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator</a>
        if you have significant self-employment income like a stipend based job
        in which you receive a 1099 (ie. After School Matter or rideshare job).
        In this case, you may want to select to have additional funds withheld
        in step 4 to cover the obligations from these positions. People often
        chose to have 20% of these annual earnings withheld and divide this
        total cost over the pay period. For example, if Mary earns $1,000 each
        year from a rideshare job and is working as an employee in the summer
        for 5 weeks. Mary would want to have 20% of the $1,000 withheld or $200.
        Mary would divide that tax obligation over 5 weeks $200/5=$40 and have
        $40 per week withheld in extra obligations.)
      </li>
      <li>
        IMPORTANT: Don’t forget to complete step 5 and sign and date your W-4.
        (The line below your signature will be completed by your employer.)
      </li>
    </ul>
